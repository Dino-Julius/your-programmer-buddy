- [Spanish version (Original)](README.md)

This repository is a collection of the codes that I have made/used during my studies.
Programming languages:
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/)
- [Wolfram Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/)

*the purpose of this repository is that the codes serve as inspiration, support or example for any living being, respects the authorship of the program, copying without knowing how the code works is useless*
